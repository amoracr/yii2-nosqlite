NoSQLite
========
A NoSQL Database, with the portability of SQLite 

This extension is based on:
- [MongoLite](https://github.com/agentejo/mongo-lite) by [Agentejo](https://github.com/agentejo).
- [SleekDB](https://github.com/rakibtg/SleekDB) by [Kazi Mehedi Hasan](https://github.com/rakibtg),
- [NoSQLite](https://github.com/HiruNya/nosqlite) by [Hiruna Jayamanne](https://github.com/HiruNya).
- [NoSqLite](https://github.com/phpgearbox/nosqlite) by [phpgearbox](https://github.com/phpgearbox).
- [NoSQLite](https://github.com/williamstein/nosqlite) by [William Stein](https://github.com/williamstein).

I combined those sources and made an extension for Yii.
